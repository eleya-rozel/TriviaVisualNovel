This is a mix of a visual novel and a trivia game, featuring multiple different endings and background music.
It uses complex topics, such as (but not limited to) a slick UI, recursion, and selectionsort.

1. Please run this program via IDE!

2. Answer each question with the "next" button. Exiting a popup window will close the program.

3. Getting a bad ending will not print your stats. Instead, you can choose to restart or quit.

4. There is music, so please turn the sound on!

5. Printed stats can be found in the "Results" folder.

6. Do not change anything in the Resources folder!

If the administrator would like to skip the trivia section, uncomment the sections in GUI.java where it will allow you to skip by entering "6".
